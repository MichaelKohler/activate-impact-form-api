# MozActivate Impact Form API
API for the view on how well activities from activate.mozilla.community were perceived to give organizers feedback on their event.

This reads from the impact form which is presented at the end of all activities to participants. The frontend code will be implemented on [MozActivate](https://activate.mozilla.community).

## Run the API

First you need to create a ```client_secret.json``` file as described [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs).

```
$ cp config-sample.json config.json
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now you can find the API on ```localhost:5500```.

## The following endpoints are available
